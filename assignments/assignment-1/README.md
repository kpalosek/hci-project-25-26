## Problem statement:
Getting from the airport to your accommodation is often the most stressful part of a trip.
* Information about transfer options from airports to city centers is **scattered across the Internet**
* Many sources are **unreliable** or **outdated**, leading to confusion and wasted time
* Travellers often **overpay** for transportation because they are not aware of better alternatives

## Target users:
* **Leisure travellers** — tourists visiting new destinations
* **Business travellers** — professionals needing reliable and time-efficient transfers
* **Digital nomads** — frequent travellers seeking convenience and flexibility

## Proposed soultion:
Air2City is a web application that helps users quickly find **reliable**, **up-to-date**, and **clear** information about transportation options from airports to city centers — all in one place.

Users can:
  * View **all available means of transportation** (bus, train, taxi, shuttle, etc.)
  * Compare average **time**, **cost**, and **complexity** for each option
  * Access **simple**, **step-by-step instructions** for how to get to the city
  
The application allows travellers to choose their preferred mode of transportation based on parameters such as **price**, **duration**, or **simplicity** — helping them travel smarter and with less stress.

## How I came up with the idea?
The idea for Air2City came both from my own past experiences as well as from observing others struggle with the same problems - spending unnecessary time researching and overpaying for transportation.
Air2City aims to solve these problems by providing travellers with all essential transportation information from airport to city in one place — **reliable**, **up-to-date**, and **easy to follow**.
