# 1. Personas
To better understand the needs, goals, and behaviors of potential users, several **personas** were developed based on typical travel scenarios relevant to the Air2City platform.

Each persona represents a different user group with distinct motivations — from **frequent travelers** looking for efficiency, to **budget-conscious students** and **casual tourists** seeking clear and reliable guidance.
These personas serve as a foundation for designing features, information flow, and interface elements that align with real user expectations.

# 2. Card Sorting & Information Architecture (IA)
The **information architecture** defines the hierarchical organization of content within Air2City.

It reflects the results of the **card sorting** exercise done by LLM (one that did not have any  previous context regarding the app apart from the cards it was given), grouping features into four main areas:
**Explore**, **Live Updates**, **My Account** and **About**.
Each section is structured to ensure intuitive navigation and access to essential travel information.

| **Main Section**              | **Subsections / Elements**                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | **Description / Purpose**                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

# 3. Sitemap
The **sitemap** illustrates the navigational structure of the Air2City application.
It is organized around five primary sections: **Search**, **Explore**, **News & Updates**, **About**, and **Account**.

The Explore section follows a hierarchical model (Continent → Country → City → Airport),
while other sections remain shallow for quick access to features such as user posts, saved guides, and live updates.
This structure ensures intuitive navigation and a clear path to essential travel information.
